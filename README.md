Users can enter lottery with ETH based on a USD fee
An admit will choose when the lottery is over
The lottery will select a random winner
Since we have an admin, this app is not fully decentralized, we could scale it further to a DAO, or the lottery automatically start and close, but for now this is what we're working with.

How do we want to test this?

 1. `mainnet-fork`
 2. `development with mocks`
 3. `testnet`
